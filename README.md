We have chosen the challenge titled "Seismic Detection Across the Solar System", because our interest in signal processing and seismic events.

- The field of planetary seismology faces a lack of data to study the structure of other planets, due to the difficulty of transferring high-resolution seismic signals back to Earth. 🌌📶📡💭🤔
- Last data from the Moon dates back to the 1970's and the Apollo mission. 🎞️🎥📼📺
- The power required to transmit signals from other planets is huge, and the energy available in landers must be shared across a wide array of scientific sensors. 🔋📵
- Normally, quakes are rare events, meaning that although large amounts of continuous data are recorded and transmitted back to Earth, for scientist only a small fraction of this data contains useful information.🧵🔍🌾🕵️‍♂️
- So we will propose solutions to fix this issue, with Free and open knowledge 📖
